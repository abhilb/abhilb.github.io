I am starting over for the third time now, dropping all my previous half-baked posts and drafts. This time around, I want to create something similar to [Simon Willison's website](https://simonwillison.net): a combination of TILs (Today I Learned), Projects, Things I Found (Link Blog), and book reviews.

### TILs
TILs or "Today I Learned" posts are short, focused entries about new discoveries in programming, technology, or any other interesting field. These bite-sized pieces of knowledge are perfect for documenting learning moments and sharing them with others. I plan to write TILs about programming, computer vision, and machine learning â€“ areas where I spend most of my time learning and working.

### Projects
Currently, I maintain one open-source project: [mukham](https://github.com/abhilb/mukham.git), which is a facial recognition application. While this is my main project, I plan to document any interesting side projects or experiments I work on in the future. This section will serve as both a portfolio and a way to share my experiences building software.

### Link Blog
There's no better explanation of what a link blog is than the one from Simon's [post](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/9/a-link-blog-in-the-year-2024/), which I quote here:

> "Link blogging is a pleasantly low-pressure way of writing online. Found something interesting? Post a link to it, with a sentence or two about why it's worth checking out."

I'll be sharing interesting articles, tools, and resources I come across, particularly in the fields of software development, artificial intelligence, and technology in general.

### Book Reviews
Reading is an essential part of continuous learning. In this section, I'll share my thoughts on books I've read, focusing primarily on technical books but occasionally including other genres that I find valuable for personal and professional growth.
