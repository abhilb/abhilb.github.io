As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with nearly two decades of experience, I specialize in Computer Vision and Image Processing, focusing on developing cutting-edge solutions for identity verification and document inspection systems.

Currently at IDnow GmbH in Munich, I develop sophisticated deep learning models for detecting fraudulent identity documents, helping to make digital identity verification more secure and reliable. My expertise spans both classical computer vision techniques and modern deep learning frameworks, allowing me to bridge traditional methodologies with cutting-edge AI solutions.

Originally from India and now based in Munich, I've contributed to innovative solutions at industry leaders like Bundesdruckerei GmbH and Samsung. As a Certified Software Architect and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO), I combine technical expertise with project management skills to create solutions that are both technically robust and business-practical. When not immersed in code, you'll find me on the badminton court, enjoying a good game.
